# Eighty-six Timer
[日本語](README.ja.md)

Translated at DeepL. There may be a problem.

The timer at the start of the operation that appeared in episode 18 of the TV anime "86 - Eighty Six".

## Usage
## Control
This is a web application that can be used from [here](http://86t.noyciy.ga/).
It will start counting down 5 hours ahead from the time you open it.  
By clicking SETTING and entering the target date in Target date and the target time in Target time, the difference from the current time will be displayed.  
Click STOP to pause (the target time does not change).  
You will hear a sound for about 3 seconds after the target time is reached. <span style="color: red;">Please pay attention to the volume. </span> To get around the autoplay block, open the page and click somewhere on the timer once. (Sound:ON will be printed to the console.)  
### Airframe
Open Airframe from SETTING in Control, and it will count to the same target time as Control. No sound is produced. No sound, no settings from this screen. It's just a bonus.

## System Requirements
Works fine with Brave (Chromium-based). Probably also works with Chrome and Edge.  
The sound does not play properly in Firefox (it is not pronounced clearly). Other than that, it works fine.
